# SafeGuard AI: Multi-Agent Food Compliance System
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Anagha-Rao-53/multiagent-food-compliance/blob/main/main.ipynb)

## Overview
**SafeGuard AI** is an AI-powered food safety compliance system that uses a multi-agent approach to automate food safety audits and enhance risk identification. By leveraging a team of specialized agents, the system streamlines the compliance process, reduces human error, and ensures adherence to HACCP guidelines effectively.

## Features
- **Multi-Agent System**: Utilizes multiple AI agents working collaboratively for comprehensive compliance monitoring.
- **Automated Risk Identification**: Identifies potential hazards in real-time during food processing.
- **HACCP Compliance**: Ensures adherence to industry-standard food safety practices.
- **Efficient Documentation**: Automates the generation of digital audit trails for easy reporting and record-keeping.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language for backend processing.
- **Gradio**: Frontend interface for user interaction.
- **CrewAI Framework**: Utilized for implementing multi-agent systems.
- **Groq's Mixtral-8x7b Model**: AI model for document processing and risk analysis.

2. Cooling (CCP-2)
   - Critical Limit: Max 4°C within 2 hours
   - Monitoring: Temperature check every 30 minutes
   - Corrective Action: Adjust cooling system, evaluate product for safety
   
3. Metal Detection (CCP-3)
   - Critical Limit: No metal fragments >2mm
   - Monitoring: All packages pass through metal detector
   - Corrective Action: Reject affected products, inspect equipment
```
