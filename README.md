# SafeGuard AI: Multi-Agent Food Compliance System
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Anagha-Rao-53/multiagent-food-compliance/blob/main/main.ipynb)

## Overview
**SafeGuard AI** is an AI-powered food safety compliance system that uses a multi-agent approach to automate food safety audits and enhance risk identification. By leveraging a team of specialized agents, the system streamlines the compliance process, reduces human error, and ensures adherence to HACCP guidelines effectively.

## Features
- **Multi-Agent System**: Utilizes multiple AI agents working collaboratively for comprehensive compliance monitoring.
- **Automated Risk Identification**: Identifies potential hazards in real-time during food processing.
- **HACCP Compliance**: Ensures adherence to industry-standard food safety practices.
- **Efficient Documentation**: Automates the generation of digital audit trails for easy reporting and record-keeping.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language for backend processing.
- **Gradio**: Frontend interface for user interaction.
- **CrewAI Framework**: Utilized for implementing multi-agent systems.
- **Groq's Mixtral-8x7b Model**: AI model for document processing and risk analysis.

## Example Production Records

### Production Details
```
Production Start Time: 06:00
Batch Size: 5000 liters
Pasteurization Temperature: 72.5Â°C
Holding Time: 15 seconds
Cooling Temperature: 4Â°C
Equipment: Pasteurizer Unit #2
Operator: J. Smith
Supervisor: M. Johnson
```

### Critical Control Points (CCPs)
```
1. Pasteurization (CCP-1)
   - Critical Limit: Min 72Â°C for 15 seconds
   - Monitoring: Continuous temperature recording
   - Corrective Action: If temperature drops below 72Â°C, divert flow and reprocess
   
2. Cooling (CCP-2)
   - Critical Limit: Max 4Â°C within 2 hours
   - Monitoring: Temperature check every 30 minutes
   - Corrective Action: Adjust cooling system, evaluate product for safety
   
3. Metal Detection (CCP-3)
   - Critical Limit: No metal fragments >2mm
   - Monitoring: All packages pass through metal detector
   - Corrective Action: Reject affected products, inspect equipment
```

### Daily Quality Checks
```
Raw Milk Testing:
* Temperature: 3.8Â°C
* pH: 6.7
* Antibiotic Test: Negative

Finished Product Testing:
* Fat Content: 3.25%
* Temperature: 3.9Â°C
* Coliform Count: <10 CFU/ml
* Standard Plate Count: 8,000 CFU/ml
```

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a more user-friendly UI for enhanced interaction.
- Integrate advanced pattern recognition for improved risk prediction.
- Expand the multi-agent system to handle more complex compliance scenarios.
