Choose pasteurized milk and dairy products, making sure to read labels carefully. Refrigerate perishable foods at 40°F or colder to slow bacterial growth.

Pasteurization, pioneered by Louis Pasteur in the nineteenth century, involves heating raw milk to a moderate temperature (72 °C for 15 s) followed by rapid cooling. Ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) processing, on the other hand, entails heating milk to ultrahigh temperatures (135 °C) for a short duration (2-5 s) and then rapidly ... Fresh milk refers to pasteurized milk, which is sterilized at a low temperature of 72°C to 85°C, which can maximize the nutritional value of milk while killing harmful bacteria. However, the shelf life is only 3 to 7 days and requires low-temperature transportation and storage. Because pasteurization cannot effectively kill all harmful ...
